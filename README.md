Omniauth Strategy to use autistici / inventati sso.

Used like other omniauth strategies. Requires a key to validate signatures and a service_id to identify the service itself.

The constructor takes the service_id and the verification key as parameters. In comparison with other services they replace the id and the secret provided by the IDP.
